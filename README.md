Distance-Independent Background Light Estimation Method.

A distance-independent background light estimation method is proposed for the underwater overhead images. The method addresses the challenge of the absence of the farthest point in underwater overhead images by adopting a global perspective to select the optimal solution and estimate the background light by minimizing the loss function. Moreover, to enhance the information retention in the images, a translation function is employed to adjust the transmission map values within the range of [0.1, 0.95]. Additionally, the method capitalizes on the redundancy of image information and the similarity of adjacent frames, resulting in higher computational efficiency.
